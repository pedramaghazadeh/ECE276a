Each notebook is named for the specific stage of the project. The ICP poses are saved in the code/icp_warm_up as well as the part2 Jupyter notebook. The requirements.txt files includes everything needed to run the scripts (nothing out of order). You can select the dataset 20 or 21 fir each of the parts. For the factor graph, there is an additional argument cumulative. This should be set to True for all datasets without "transitions" in them, it indicates whether poses are from i to i+1 or from 0 to i+1. Due to numerical inaccuracies it is better to use accumulated=False for GTSAM part.
